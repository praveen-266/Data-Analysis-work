# Data Analysis Work

In this repository, you will find information about my data analysis work, including key features, skills, technologies used, and how to get in touch with me.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** I have experience in cleaning and preprocessing large datasets, ensuring data integrity and removing any inconsistencies or errors that may affect the analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I excel at performing EDA to gain insights into the data. I utilize various statistical techniques, visualizations, and data mining methods to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends.

- **Statistical Analysis:** I have a strong background in statistics and can apply a wide range of statistical techniques to analyze data. From hypothesis testing to regression analysis, I can provide robust statistical insights.

- **Data Visualization:** I believe in the power of effective data visualization. I can create compelling visualizations using tools like Python's matplotlib and seaborn libraries, Tableau, or Power BI to present data-driven stories in an intuitive and engaging manner.

- **Feature Selection:**  I employ various statistical techniques, such as correlation analysis, information gain, and mutual information, to identify features with high predictive power.

- **Feature Engineering:**  I apply various techniques, such as logarithmic transformations, scaling, and one-hot encoding, to ensure that features are in the appropriate format and have the desired statistical properties.
